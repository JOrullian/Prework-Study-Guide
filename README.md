# <prework-study-guide>

## Description

The motivation of this project was to follow a guideline to create a functional bootcamp study guide for all material discussed in the prework.  Along the way, I was introduced and exposed to many beginning aspects of coding and used basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript to desing the webpage.  Moving forward, I hope this project will be used to remind myself and any others of fundamental lessons on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
